# 2016
This is the repository for the 2016 UAS drone, built for our April 2018 competition.

## Structure
[Will fill]

## Installation
This code was built solely for our set up, so it's not easily transferrable. But if you want to try, be our guest. All the information you need to set it up should be available in this README, but if it's not complete, specifically if the [Will fill] tags are still here, please yell at us at sdsmt.uas@gmail.com.
